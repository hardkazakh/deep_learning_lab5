# Deep Learning: Assignmnet 5
1. Load your dataset from the “CO2 Emissions.csv” csv file.
2. Explore your dataset and list the name of the text columns.
3. Explore your dataset and check if there is any column with missing values.
4. Select your input variables (only select integer valued columns and columns without missing 
values) and ourput variable (hint: output colum is the one you want to predict).
5. Split your dataset as %80 training and %20 testing.
6. Scale your training data and testing data inputs.
After them do the following steps:
7. Implement three different neural networks one with 1 layer, one with 2 layers and one with 3 
layers using either the ski-learn or Keras python libraries and train them using the training 
dataset. 
8. Compare their accuracies by means of the test data set using Mean Absolute Error, Mean 
Squared Error, R2 score and Root Mean Squared Error metrics. Which neural network is better 
than the others. 
9. Plot the Actual vs Predicted graph of the best model
